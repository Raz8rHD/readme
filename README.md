# The Last Drop
## _Development Journal_
 - _The Last drop_ is a project developed by a team of games design and development students. The game's core was established by teachers and is intended to be further developed and polished by the students in order to create a fully functional product that will later be published on Steam.
 - The main concept of the game is a humanoid-looking character with a detacheable head (a bubble) that can be controlled by the player with a mouse. The bubble can interact with objects and navigate through specific areas to help the character progress to the next level. _The Last Drop_ is a puzzle-based game that challanges players with engaging mechanics and increasing difficulty, providing a unique and evolving gameplay experience.
