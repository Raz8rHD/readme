# The Last Drop
## Development Journal
## _Project outline_
 - _The Last drop_ is a project developed by a team of games design and development students. The game's core was established by teachers and is intended to be further developed and polished by the students in order to create a fully functional product that will later be published on Steam.
 - The main concept of the game is a humanoid-looking character with a detacheable head (a bubble) that can be controlled by the player with a mouse. The bubble can interact with objects and navigate through specific areas to help the character progress to the next level. _The Last Drop_ is a puzzle-based game that challanges players with engaging mechanics and increasing difficulty, providing a unique and evolving gameplay experience.
 - The purpose of this project is to provide students with firsthand expereince of working in a large development team. It offers insight into the production pipeline and the various stages a game undergoes before it is ready for release. This process helps students gaina clearer understanding of what working in the games industry is really like.
## _Initial goals and Objectives_
 - I have been given the role of Audio Designer, where I am responsible for everything related to sound in the game. Whether the game lacked ambiance or sound effects that could be improved, I took on the resposibility of providing what was needed to enhance the overall exprience.
 - My primary objective as an Audio Designer is to create, compose, and produce soundtracks that complement the aesthetic and atmosphere of each individual level. I aim to tailor the music to enhance the mood of the environment, whether it's a tense, action-packed sequence or a calm, introspective moment. If I find that a soundtrack may distract from the player's focus, I will shift towards creating subtle ambient sounds. These ambient soundscapes are designed to immerse the player more naturally, maintaining a strong connection to the game world while ensuring the focus remains on gameplay. My goal is always to strike a balance between enhancing the overall experience and preserving the player's engagement with the game mechanics.
 - In order to achieve the desired sound for the project, I will need to revisit Logic Pro and build upon the foundation I gained during college. While I have a solid understanding of the basics, my goal is to elevate my skills and push myself further in order to deliver a more polished and dynamic audio experience. I’m eager to refine my techniques and explore more advanced features that Logic Pro offers, allowing me to create richer, more intricate soundscapes. Music composition remains a passion of mine, and I view this project as an excellent opportunity to not only improve my technical skills but also to fully immerse myself in the creative process. I’m excited to challenge myself and take my sound design to the next level, making sure that every note, sound, and atmosphere enhances the player’s experience.
## _Challenges/Potential issues_
 - Working closely with the design team, discussing ideas and visions, and narrowing them down to just a few strong concepts will be a challenging process. Brainstorming sessions will be frequent, and during these discussions, some ideas may be scrapped and need to be reworked, while others will be approved for further development. This iterative process is time-consuming and requires a great deal of patience from all involved. However, it’s an essential part of creating a high-quality project, as it ensures that only the best ideas make it through. Ultimately, we are all working toward the same goal: to deliver a product that reflects our collective effort and passion. While it may take time, we understand that each decision we make, no matter how small, contributes to the overall success of the project.
 - When creating soundtracks, sound effects, or ambient sounds, a lack of inspiration and creativity can become a significant challenge. It often acts as a roadblock, preventing me from achieving the exact sound I envision for the project. While I might have a rough idea of how I want the soundtracks to feel or a specific sound and pitch in my head, translating that vision into a finished piece can be incredibly time-consuming. I may spend hours, sometimes even days, trying to perfect the sound or get it as close as possible to what I originally imagined.

## Research
## _Methodology_
 - I have found it incredibly useful to listen to soundtracks from video games and movies, as they have been a great source of inspiration in developing my understanding of the relationship between what is seen and what is heard. As part of my creative process, I’ve also made a conscious effort to explore various musical genres—ranging from classical and ambient to RnB, rock, synthwave, and experimental sound design. This exposure has broadened my creative palette and helped me think more openly when composing and arranging for different moods and scenes. Listening to music with a more analytical ear—paying attention to how a track is layered, how instruments interact, and how transitions are handled—has been a key part of my growth. I’ve learned to appreciate the subtle details that make a soundtrack effective, such as dynamic contrast, pacing, and spatial awareness in the mix. All of this has contributed to refining my own style and making more intentional choices when designing sound for this project.
