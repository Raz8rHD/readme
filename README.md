# The Last Drop
## Development Journal
## _Project outline_
 - _The Last drop_ is a project developed by a team of games design and development students. The game's core was established by teachers and is intended to be further developed and polished by the students in order to create a fully functional product that will later be published on Steam.
 - The main concept of the game is a humanoid-looking character with a detacheable head (a bubble) that can be controlled by the player with a mouse. The bubble can interact with objects and navigate through specific areas to help the character progress to the next level. _The Last Drop_ is a puzzle-based game that challanges players with engaging mechanics and increasing difficulty, providing a unique and evolving gameplay experience.
 - The purpose of this project is to provide students with firsthand expereince of working in a large development team. It offers insight into the production pipeline and the various stages a game undergoes before it is ready for release. This process helps students gaina clearer understanding of what working in the games industry is really like.
## _Initial goals and Objectives_
 - I have been given the role of Audio Designer, where I am responsible for everything related to sound in the game. Whether the game lacked ambiance or sound effects that could be improved, I took on the resposibility of providing what was needed to enhance the overall exprience.
 - My primary objective as an Audio Designer is to create, compose, and produce soundtracks that complement the aesthetic and atmosphere of each individual level. I aim to tailor the music to enhance the mood of the environment, whether it's a tense, action-packed sequence or a calm, introspective moment. If I find that a soundtrack may distract from the player's focus, I will shift towards creating subtle ambient sounds. These ambient soundscapes are designed to immerse the player more naturally, maintaining a strong connection to the game world while ensuring the focus remains on gameplay. My goal is always to strike a balance between enhancing the overall experience and preserving the player's engagement with the game mechanics.
 - In order to achieve the desired sound for the project, I will need to revisit Logic Pro and build upon the foundation I gained during college. While I have a solid understanding of the basics, my goal is to elevate my skills and push myself further in order to deliver a more polished and dynamic audio experience. I’m eager to refine my techniques and explore more advanced features that Logic Pro offers, allowing me to create richer, more intricate soundscapes. Music composition remains a passion of mine, and I view this project as an excellent opportunity to not only improve my technical skills but also to fully immerse myself in the creative process. I’m excited to challenge myself and take my sound design to the next level, making sure that every note, sound, and atmosphere enhances the player’s experience.
## _Challenges/Potential issues_
 - Working closely with the design team, discussing ideas and visions, and narrowing them down to just a few strong concepts will be a challenging process. Brainstorming sessions will be frequent, and during these discussions, some ideas may be scrapped and need to be reworked, while others will be approved for further development. This iterative process is time-consuming and requires a great deal of patience from all involved. However, it’s an essential part of creating a high-quality project, as it ensures that only the best ideas make it through. Ultimately, we are all working toward the same goal: to deliver a product that reflects our collective effort and passion. While it may take time, we understand that each decision we make, no matter how small, contributes to the overall success of the project.
 - When creating soundtracks, sound effects, or ambient sounds, a lack of inspiration and creativity can become a significant challenge. It often acts as a roadblock, preventing me from achieving the exact sound I envision for the project. While I might have a rough idea of how I want the soundtracks to feel or a specific sound and pitch in my head, translating that vision into a finished piece can be incredibly time-consuming. I may spend hours, sometimes even days, trying to perfect the sound or get it as close as possible to what I originally imagined.

## Research
## _Methodology_
 - I have found it incredibly useful to listen to soundtracks from video games and movies, watch gameplay of similar titles, and explore different mechanics from a variety of puzzle-based games. These specific sources have had a strong influence on my work, encouraging me to shift my perspective and take a more thoughtful, player-focused approach to this project.
 - Initially, I was primarily thinking about what I wanted to experience during gameplay. However, as I immersed myself in research and analysis, I began to understand the importance of designing with the target audience in mind. I started asking myself how players might perceive the game, how they would interpret the puzzles, and what kind of audio experience would best support their immersion and engagement.
 - Game testing with individuals outside of our class has been a particularly eye-opening experience—something I had previously overlooked. Gathering feedback from a wider audience provided diverse perspectives that challenged some of our assumptions and highlighted areas that needed improvement. By asking varied and targeted questions during these sessions, we were able to collect valuable insights that helped refine both the gameplay and the audio design. This iterative feedback loop has proven essential in polishing the final product and ensuring that it resonates not just with the development team, but with players as well.
## _Game Sources_
 - Personally, I’ve drawn a lot of inspiration from _Little Nightmares_, as I’ve noticed several similarities between it and _The Last Drop_. At first glance, both games introduce the player to a side-scrolling perspective, where the world is revealed gradually from left to right. This visual style creates a strong sense of progression while also maintaining a cinematic atmosphere.
 - One of the most striking similarities is the scale and perspective of the player character. In both games, the character appears small in comparison to the vast, often ominous environment around them. This visual contrast creates a sense of vulnerability and unease, making the player feel isolated and somewhat powerless—a feeling that significantly enhances immersion, especially in darker or more mysterious settings.
 - The game mechanics in _Little Nightmares_ are particularly clever. The protagonist must interact with their surroundings—pushing, pulling, climbing, and using objects in creative ways—to solve puzzles and advance. Similarly, in _The Last Drop_, the bubble mechanic allows players to pick up and manipulate objects to solve challenges. This interaction with the environment not only makes gameplay more engaging but also helps the world feel more alive and responsive.
 - By allowing players to experiment with their surroundings and discover solutions organically, both games achieve a natural flow in puzzle-solving. This design encourages exploration, reinforces curiosity, and enhances player agency without relying on heavy-handed instructions or tutorials. In _The Last Drop_, I believe this kind of interactivity is key to building levels that feel both immersive and rewarding, while still maintaining a healthy level of challenge.
 - Drawing from games like _Little Nightmares_ has helped me better understand how visual storytelling, scale, sound design, and mechanics can work together to create a deeply atmospheric experience—something I strive to contribute to through my audio work on this project.
## _Academic Sources_
 - _Game Audio Mixing: Insights to Improve Your Mixing Performance_ by Alex Riviere is a comprehensive guide that delves into the intricacies of mixing audio specifically for video games. Recognizing a gap in resources tailored to interactive media, Riviere offers both philosophical insights and practical techniques to enhance the mixing process in game development.
 - A significant portion of the book is dedicated to the prioritization of sounds, discussing techniques for designing a priority scheme, defining focal points, and determining which sounds need to play in different game contexts to avoid sensory overload and maintain player engagement.​
 - Reading this book has helped me gain a broader understanding of how music should be produced in a way that supports the gameplay without distracting the player. It also taught me the importance of ensuring consistency across all audio elements, sound prioritization to maintain clarity, and technical mastery in mixing techniques. Gaining these new insights has made me rethink my entire approach to producing ambient sound for the project. Instead of focusing solely on filling the silence, I am now considering how each sound can subtly enhance the atmosphere, guide the player's emotions, and contribute to a more immersive and cohesive gameplay experience.
## _Documentation Sources_
 - The guide from Epic Games explains how to create procedural music in Unreal Engine 5.5 using MetaSounds. It covers building a dynamic music system driven by gameplay events, focusing on setting up tempo and rhythm, generating melodies procedurally, and synthesizing sound using sine waves. The method allows deep control over audio behavior with Blueprint integration for real-time interaction. This system enhances immersion by making music react organically to gameplay (https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/creating-procedural-music-with-metasounds).
 - A livestream that dives into metasounds and carries on with the process of producing and mixing in Unreal Engine (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YusSLuOcILc&t=906s).
 - These two sources have helped me acquire a much deeper understanding of how to use Unreal Engine’s built-in features, particularly MetaSounds, to create adaptive and procedural music. Learning about techniques like dynamic sound generation and real-time audio manipulation has allowed me to think beyond traditional soundtrack composition. This knowledge has given me more creative control and technical confidence when producing ambient sounds and music for the project.

## Implementation
## _Process_
 - First things first, I started working in Logic Pro, composing my music based on the information, images, and ideas shared by the team regarding the direction of the designed levels and the overall aesthetic of each individual environment. My initial compositions began with simple synth sounds, establishing a foundation that matched the intended atmosphere. Over time, I carefully layered in different sound effects such as reverb, tape delay, and bitcrusher, as well as additional instruments, to create a richer, more fleshed-out soundscape. This iterative process allowed me to experiment with different textures and moods, ensuring that the music evolved alongside the visual and gameplay elements. I found that by adjusting and refining the sound with each feedback session, I could better align the audio with the emotional tone and pacing of each level, making the soundtrack an integral part of the player's experience.
 - The more I worked toward achieving the desired sound, the more I realized that I didn’t need a large number of tracks or a wide variety of instruments to create a strong, impactful atmosphere. In fact, the soundtracks became richer and more cohesive the fewer elements I used, they blended well and were carefully aligned to the same tempo. This approach prevented the music from sounding chaotic or disconnected. I also focused heavily on crafting emotional depth within the ambiance, which proved to be one of the most challenging aspects of the process.
## _New Approaches_
 - I took a different approach to composing music for this project compared to what I had been taught in college. Back then, the focus was on creating as many "green tracks" as possible—tracks fully crafted by the producer, avoiding the use of any pre-made or pre-recorded sounds. I initially started composing with this mindset, determined to create everything from scratch. However, as the project evolved, I realized that the sounds and instruments available in Logic Pro’s sound library are there for a reason: to be used creatively and effectively.
 - By combining my own original sounds with carefully selected library assets, I was able to take my production skills to a new level. This approach not only enhanced the quality and depth of my compositions but also gave me a much better understanding of Logic Pro’s full capabilities. It taught me that creativity doesn’t mean doing everything from zero—it means knowing how and when to use all the tools at your disposal to serve the final vision.
## _Testing_
 - Testing was primarily focused on the mechanics, ensuring that all gameplay elements worked together smoothly. Some issues were identified and resolved immediately, while others required weeks of investigation, as it was often difficult to pinpoint the exact source of the problems.
 - In terms of ambiance testing, the approach was more visual and auditory: we observed rough versions of the levels while listening to the corresponding soundtracks to assess whether the music complemented the aesthetic and atmosphere of each environment. This process highlighted the importance of aligning sound design closely with visual cues, and it allowed for further fine-tuning of the audio to better support the player's emotional experience.
## _Technical Difficulties_
 - GitHub turned out to be one of the biggest challenges we faced during the project. With so many people working on different branches, there were frequent issues such as team members pushing changes directly to the main branch without proper communication, important files getting deleted or overwritten, and even entire sections of work disappearing. These mistakes often forced us to revert to older versions of the project, which was time-consuming and frustrating. Overall, managing the GitHub repository became a major hassle and highlighted the critical need for better version control practices, clearer communication, and a more structured workflow when collaborating on large projects.
 - Levels not being completed on time pushed my music production back significantly. Not only that, but I originally based my compositions on early descriptions of what the levels were supposed to look like. By week 8, however, I was shown a completely different design that no longer aligned with the music I had created. As a result, I was forced to re-write large portions of my work, but by that point, I struggled with a lack of inspiration and motivation. It was incredibly frustrating to feel that my efforts had been wasted, and it made it much harder to maintain creative momentum. This experience really highlighted the importance of having a more finalized visual direction early on, as changes late in development can heavily impact other areas like sound design and music production.
 - Not being able to open the project at home was a major issue, as I could only complete my work at university. For someone who has to commute, it was unpleasant to come in on days without lessons or to stay late—both scenarios meant extra travel time and expense. Moreover, my progress was isolated: I couldn’t work on the project at home, so I had to carry my laptop with all the music files wherever I went.
 - My music might not make it into the game initially due to technical issues and a lack of time to fully explore Unreal’s mixing and mastering capabilities. Additionally, my compositions were written for a completely different level design, which no longer aligns with the current version. I know I can do much better, but I will still include a folder with my rough mixes for consideration.
