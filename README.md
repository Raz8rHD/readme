# The Last Drop
## Development Journal
## _Project outline_
 - _The Last drop_ is a project developed by a team of games design and development students. The game's core was established by teachers and is intended to be further developed and polished by the students in order to create a fully functional product that will later be published on Steam.
 - The main concept of the game is a humanoid-looking character with a detacheable head (a bubble) that can be controlled by the player with a mouse. The bubble can interact with objects and navigate through specific areas to help the character progress to the next level. _The Last Drop_ is a puzzle-based game that challanges players with engaging mechanics and increasing difficulty, providing a unique and evolving gameplay experience.
 - The purpose of this project is to provide students with firsthand expereince of working in a large development team. It offers insight into the production pipeline and the various stages a game undergoes before it is ready for release. This process helps students gaina clearer understanding of what working in the games industry is really like.
## _Initial goals and Objectives_
 - I have been given the role of "Audio Designer", where I am responsible for everything related to sound in the game. Whether the game lacked ambiance or sound effects that could be improved, I took on the resposibility of providing what was needed to enhance the overall exprience.
